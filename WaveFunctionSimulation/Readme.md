##Diffraction
The m-Files for Drawing surface wave's diffraction by slit

1. Single Slit Diffraction
2. Double Slit Diffraction

###File Detail

* All plot's xlimit and ylimit is set [0, 20] <br>

1. Single Slit Diffraction
  - diffractionFunctionplot.m <br>
  The function file for Surf Plot. <br>
  input : slit hole width, wavelength <br>
  
  - diffraction.m <br>
  Script file to make plots on grid of subplots. <br>
  Make 3 by 3 subplot. <br>
  can put variance and compare.<br>
  <br>

2. Double Slit Diffraction and interference
  - DdiffractionFunctionplot.m <br>
  The function file for Surf Plot. <br>
  input :  wavelength, slit hole width, slit gap (length of wall between slit hole) <br>
  
  - Ddiffraction.m <br>
  Script file to make plots on grid of subplots. <br>
  Make 3 by 3 subplot. <br>
  can put variance and compare.
